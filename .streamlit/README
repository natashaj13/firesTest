welcome to FireWatch!
The app displays a map of all current fires, updated daily. 
When the user clicks on the map, we calculate the risk from the closest fire and output whether the user\'s 
location is safe or within the danger zone. The risk is calculated using current weather and geographical data, 
and if the user is at risk from the closest fire, we output the predicted burn radius. We provide links and resources 
for those who need help and helpful tips. And, there\'s a chatbot for anyone who is curious or asking for fire-related questions!
